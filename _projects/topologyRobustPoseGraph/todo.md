### Robust Pose Graph Optimization through Topologyical Data Analysis

- [ ] Look into open-source software
    - [ ] [topological mapper](http://danifold.net/mapper/)
    - [ ] [Persistent Homology in C++](http://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/nanda/perseus/index.html)


- [ ] conduct simple test case on pose-graph
    - [ ]  write script to generate pose-graphs
