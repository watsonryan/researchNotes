# First Attempt at Drone Tracking in Tunnel

One of the core sensors that will be utilized for our rover/drone relative navigation algorithm is the Lidar. The Lidar is utilized because it provides a location estimate of the drone with respect to the Lidar placed on the rover. However, this only works if we are able to accurately locate the drone within the point-could, which can be challenging in adverse environments (i.e., a tunnel or cave with significant dust that can obstruct objects).

As an initial test, we will utilize a dataset that contains significant dust occlusion. With this dataset we tested our detection algorithm to see the affect that dust occlusion may have. This analysis is provided in the video below, where it can be seen that the dust is significantly degrading the Lidar data, and reducing our ability to detect the drone.

# Next Steps

- Need to look into additional clustering methods for object detection.
- Need to test again with object tacking incorporated.
