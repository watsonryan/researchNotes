As we have noted though previous testing, the M-Estimator seems to be rather sensitive to the
value taking by the user-defined kernel width. Additionally, the optimal kernel width seems to 
change for every datasets. Today we starting testing both of the comments made above.

To begin testing, several minor modifications were made to the GTSAM library and a simple python interface was developed to automate the data processing. All modifications have been pushed to a [publicly available repo](https://github.com/watsonryan/summerAFIT). This repository 
also houses a collection of pose-graphs collected from various sources.

## Initial Testing

To limit the amount of time take for this initial testing, only the Huber and Tukey 
cost functions were utilized. Additionally, no false constraints were added to the 
pose-graph

As can be seen from the four images provided above, the robustness of the M-Estimator is incredibly 
sensitive to both the data-set and the kernel width.

## Next Steps 

On Monday I will start by conducting a similar test when false constraints are added to the graph
