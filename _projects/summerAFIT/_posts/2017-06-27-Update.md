# Initial Testing 

As mentioned in the previous update, the manhattan3500 data-set is being utilized to test the BMM DP-- this pose-graph is depicted in Figure 1. Initially, we process the fault-free pose-graph and the pose-graph that has 100 false constraints added with traditional $L_2$ optimization.

The residual scatter plots for the fault-free graph and the graph with 100 false constraints using $L_2$ optimization are shown in  Figures 2 and 3, respectively. This plots depict what would be expected; both distributions have approximately zero mean with the  faulty graph residuals have a larger variance.

Using the faulty residuals, the BMM DP was tested. The BMM DP provided an inlier/outlier distribution mixture as shown below. 

<br>

$$ \mu_I = [ 0.04946242, -0.05057746, -0.0594329 ]$$

$$
P_I =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    16.89882198 && -0.90303439 &&  0.08602105 \\
   -0.90303439 && 17.08403007  && 0.06889149 \\
   0.08602105 &&  0.06889149 && 10.95290421
  \end{bmatrix}
$$

<br>

$$ \mu_O = [ 0.056539, -0.35273277, -0.83455116 ] $$


$$
P_O =
  \begin{bmatrix}
     2087.43888892 && -651.08477092 &&  198.82917436 \\
   -651.08477092 && 1977.03231206  && -92.72713996 \\
   198.82917436 &&  -92.72713996 && 1264.0179354
  \end{bmatrix}
$$

<br>

Now, we can test the estimated mixture by feeding it into the Max-Mixture model to see how well it optimizes the pose-graph in comparison to $L_2$.

<br>

|    Optimization Stragety    |    Total Graph Error -- $\mathcal{X}^2$ |
| :---------------------------------: | :--------------------------: | 
| $L_2$ with no faults | 73.05       | 
| $L_2$ with faults    | 4.964e+07  | 
| Max-Mix Using BMM-BP with Faults  | 65.33      |

<br>
From this table, we can see that the BMM-BP estimate mixture preforms very well in comparison to $L_2$. 



## Next Steps 

Testing, testing, and more testing .. .
